There is a government program that monitors the amount of ice cream particles in the atmosphere. If the concentration is too low, it indicates that the population is not eating enough ice cream - which poses a serious threat to the economy and public order.

To monitor the health of ice cream, the government has set up monitoring stations in every state. At random, a new station can be added automatically. Using complex atmospheric models, the agency sets a target for each monitoring station. At regular intervals, staff go to different stations and note the actual concentration of particulate matter in the ice cream.
